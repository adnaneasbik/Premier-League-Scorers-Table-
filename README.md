Premier League Scorers Scraper

This Python script uses Beautiful Soup to scrape data from the Premier League Scorers table and extracts player rank, club, name, goals, matches, and more info. The data is then saved to a CSV file.

Installation

To use this script, you'll need to have Python 3 installed on your computer, as well as the BeautifulSoup and Requests libraries. You can install these libraries using pip:

pip install beautifulsoup4 requests

Usage

The script will create a premier_league_scorers.csv file in the same directory with the scraped data. The CSV file will contain the following columns:

Player Rank: The rank of the player in the scorers table

Player Club: The club the player belongs to

Player Name: The name of the player

Goals: The number of goals the player has scored in the Premier League

Matches: The number of matches the player has played in the Premier League

More Info: A link to more information about the player on the Premier League website

You can modify the script to extract different data or save it to a different file name.
